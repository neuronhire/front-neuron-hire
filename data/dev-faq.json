        {
          "question": "When and how do I get paid?",
          "answer": "Payments are usually monthly upon invoice submission, per the contract schedule (typical timing: invoice → payment within the agreed period, standard practice is early in the following month).

        },
        {
          "question": "Will I be paid in USD?",

        {
          "question": "Do I need to be a legal entity?",
          "answer": "We require contractors to invoice as a legal entity. If you don’t have one, we can advise options, but payments are processed only after required documentation is in place."

        {
          "question": "Will NeuronHire deduct anything from my pay?",
          "answer": "The gross price in the contract covers all costs. NeuronHire may withhold pre-agreed amounts for vendor benefits (health plans, gym, administrative service fees) only if you explicitly agree and these withholdings are listed in the contract/annex."

          "question": "Does NeuronHire offer benefits?",
          "answer": "We offer optional benefit packages (examples: health plans, gym) for eligible contractors; specifics depend on the engagement and are detailed in the contract or annex. Benefits and any related deductions are clearly disclosed before signing."

        {
          "question": "What about taxes and social contributions?",
          "answer": "As an independent contractor you are solely responsible for all taxes, social security contributions and local compliance. Tax responsibilities depend on your legal status and local law; we can share common models and connect you with local tax partners for guidance."

        {
          "question": "How does contract termination work?",
          "answer": "Termination terms vary by contract. Typical clauses allow termination with 15-day prior written notice and include remedies for breach (e.g., cure periods, fines for confidentiality breaches). Read the termination section before signing."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I subcontract my work?",

        {
          "question": "Who owns the IP of the work I do?",

        },
        {
          "question": "Will I be treated as an employee?",
          "answer": "No. You are engaged as an independent contractor. You are responsible for taxes, social contributions and compliance applicable to your jurisdiction. Contracts explicitly state there is no employment relationship."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I work with other clients while engaged?",
          "answer": "Usually yes, unless the contract includes exclusivity for the project. Any restrictions will be explicit in the agreement."
